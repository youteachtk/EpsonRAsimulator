# EPSON RC+ 7.0 Learning Coverage Inventory

Status: research baseline, not implementation-complete.

## Purpose

Track the RC+ Trainer coverage target against official Epson documentation. The goal is to let a learner practice the same concepts, names, window relationships, and workflows they will encounter in EPSON RC+ 7.0 while also exposing optional modules for learning.

Baseline environment confirmed for this project:
- EPSON RC+ 7.0
- School installation: version 7.5.3
- Robot baseline: Epson C4-A601S

## Official source baseline

- EPSON RC+ 7.0 support/manuals page:
  https://epson.com/Support/Robots/Software/Epson-RC%2B-7-0/s/SPT_R12N793031
- EPSON RC+ 7.0 (Ver. 7.5) User's Guide:
  https://files.support.epson.com/far/docs/epson_rc_pl_70_users_guide-rc700_rc90%28v75r9%29.pdf
- Epson Robot Specification Catalog / options:
  https://files.support.epson.com/far/docs/epson_robot_specification_catalog_cpd-54833r4.pdf

## Standard RC+ shell / IDE

Target coverage includes the documented main development-environment structure:
- Main parent application window
- Menu bar
- Tool bar
- Project Explorer
- Status pane/window
- Status bar
- Multiple simultaneously open child windows (MDI-style)
- Window management such as cascade/tile where applicable
- Program/source editors
- Point files and project resources
- Run/operator workflow
- Command Window
- Robot Manager
- I/O Monitor
- Task Manager
- Macros
- I/O Label Editor
- User Error Editor
- Controller-related windows/configuration

## Official top-level menu structure

Target:
- File
- Edit
- View
- Project
- Run
- Tools
- Setup
- Window
- Help

Exact submenu coverage will be inventoried from the official manual before implementation.

## Optional / advanced learning coverage

The RC+ 7.0 User's Guide and Epson option catalog document optional or advanced capabilities including:
- Vision Guide
- RC+ API / .NET support
- Security
- Conveyor Tracking
- PG Motion System / auxiliary axes
- ECP
- GUI Builder
- Force Guide
- Force Control
- Fieldbus I/O
- Parts Feeding / feeding-system integration
- OCR and Add-On Instructions where documented for the relevant RC+ generation/controller ecosystem

This list is a research baseline, not yet a claim that every option appears identically in the user's installed 7.5.3 configuration.

## Learning-state labels

Each optional capability in RC+ Trainer should be marked with metadata such as:
- Standard
- Optional software license
- Optional hardware required
- Controller/robot dependent
- Available on school setup: Yes / No / Unknown
- Implemented in trainer: Not started / Partial / Functional / High-fidelity

## Product rule

RC+ Trainer should allow learning optional modules even when the real school installation does not have them. The UI must clearly distinguish simulated learning availability from actual license/hardware availability on a real Epson controller.

## Verified shell behavior from official RC+ 7 documentation

The official RC+ 7 User's Guide confirms the following behavior for the desktop development environment:

- RC+ uses an MDI-style main environment with multiple child windows.
- Project Explorer remains alongside the child-window workspace.
- Standard top-level menus are: File, Edit, View, Project, Run, Tools, Setup, Window, Help.
- The Window menu manages open child windows and includes at least Cascade and Tile Vertical behaviors.
- Robot Manager can be configured as either:
  - an MDI child window; or
  - a foreground dialog.
- Robot Manager shortcut: F6.
- Command Window shortcut: Ctrl+M.
- I/O Monitor shortcut: Ctrl+I.
- Task Manager shortcut: Ctrl+T.

### Verified Tools menu baseline

The RC+ 7.0 manual documents these standard Tools entries:
- Robot Manager
- Command Window
- I/O Monitor
- Task Manager
- Macros
- I/O Label Editor
- User Error Editor
- Controller

### RC+ Trainer implication

The Android trainer should model these as distinct windows/tools inside the RC+ workspace rather than flattening them into a mobile dashboard. Touch adaptations may modernize window chrome and controls, but opening, focusing, switching, arranging, and using tools should teach the same mental model as RC+.

- Official Epson support PDF: https://files.support.epson.com/far/docs/r6.pdf

## Verified keyboard shortcuts baseline

Current verified examples from official RC+ 7 documentation:
- Robot Manager: F6
- Command Window: Ctrl+M
- I/O Monitor: Ctrl+I
- Task Manager: Ctrl+T

The complete shortcut inventory must be extracted from official RC+ 7 documentation and tracked here before implementation. Only verified mappings should be presented to learners as official RC+ shortcuts.

## Verified RC+ 7.0 project/file model

Official RC+ 7.0 v7.5 documentation establishes the following project structure and behavior:

- Each project has a generated project file with extension **.sprj**.
- Program/source files use **.prg** and contain SPEL+ functions.
- Include files use **.inc**.
- Robot point files use **.pts**.
- Imported macro files use **.mac**.
- Project-scoped I/O labels and user errors are managed as project data/resources.
- A file can exist physically in the project folder without being part of the project build tree; it must be added to the project before normal editing/use through the project.
- Project > Edit manages which program/include/point files are included in the project build tree.
- File > New creates Program, Include, or Point files.
- File > Open opens project Program/Include/Point files; Ctrl+O is documented.
- Project Explorer presents current project files/functions as a sorted tree and supports opening a file or jumping to a function by double-clicking.
- Project Explorer supports contextual actions for project-tree items.
- The Project Explorer pane can be hidden/shown, resized, and placed on the left or right side in RC+ 7.0.
- The Status pane is bottom-docked in RC+ 7.0 and automatically reopens when important build/error output needs to be shown.
- A default point file can be assigned per robot; common point files can also be loaded explicitly from SPEL+.

### RC+ Trainer implication

The Trainer should model a **real project model**, not a generic Android file browser. The Project Explorer is a view of the active RC+ project/build structure, while Android storage/import/export is a separate adapter layer.

- Epson RC+ 7.0 v7.5 User's Guide, Project Explorer / File / Project sections.

## Verified Project Explorer interaction baseline

From the official EPSON RC+ 7.0 User's Guide:

- Project Explorer displays project files and functions in a sorted tree.
- Double-clicking a file opens it.
- Double-clicking a function jumps directly to that function.
- The pane can be hidden/shown from View > Project Explorer.
- The pane can be resized.
- The pane can be docked on either the left or right side of the main window.
- Right-clicking a project-tree item opens a context menu.
- Verified context-menu commands shown in the manual:
  - New...
  - Open
  - Rename...
  - Remove
  - Delete
- The Status pane is bottom-docked, resizable vertically, and automatically reopens when an important error/status message must be shown.

Android design consequence:
- Keep the same tree/action model and command names.
- Use our own icons and visual styling.
- A touch equivalent for right-click still needs explicit product approval.

## Fidelity research operating rule

The user has approved a blanket fidelity rule: once an RC+ behavior is verified from official documentation or the confirmed school environment and it materially helps learning transfer, it should be carried into RC+ Trainer without requiring another yes/no decision for every small detail.

Research should therefore focus on building a complete verified inventory of:
- menus/submenus;
- toolbars and shortcuts;
- Project Explorer/project files;
- editors and point files;
- Robot Manager;
- I/O Monitor;
- Task Manager;
- Command Window;
- Controller/setup;
- build/run/status/error behavior;
- optional modules;
- MDI/window behavior;
- other documented workflows.

Escalate for product approval only when fidelity conflicts with Android usability, legal/IP boundaries, safety, hardware reality, or a significant design fork.

## Verified Robot Manager baseline for C4 / 6-axis learning

Official EPSON RC+ 7.0 v7.5 documentation shows Robot Manager as a substantial multi-page tool, not a simple jog card.

### Control Panel
Verified functions/status:
- Robot selector
- Emergency Stop status
- Safeguard status
- Motors status
- Power status
- MOTOR OFF / MOTOR ON
- POWER LOW / POWER HIGH
- Reset
- Home
- Free/Lock joint controls where supported by the robot type

For a 6-axis C4, unsupported controls must follow RC+ enable/disable behavior rather than being invented.

### Jog & Teach
Verified controls/behavior:
- Robot / Local / Tool / ECP selectors
- Jog modes: World, Tool, Local, Joint, ECP
- Speed selector
- Cartesian jog axes X/Y/Z/U/V/W for 6-axis robots
- Joint jog controls in Joint mode
- Current Position views: World / Joint / Pulse
- Current Arm Orientation fields such as Hand, Elbow, Wrist and relevant flags
- Jog Distance modes: Continuous, Long, Medium, Short
- Teach Points tab
- Execute Motion tab
- Point file and point selector
- Teach and Edit actions
- Singularity/step-jog warning behavior documented by RC+ should be represented in the simulator where applicable

### Points
Verified behavior:
- Point File selector
- Point spreadsheet
- Columns for Number, Label, X, Y, Z, U, V, W for the C4-class 6-axis example
- Delete selected point
- Delete All
- Save
- Restore
- Teaching from Jog & Teach updates the Points view
- In MDI mode, Ctrl+S saves point data

### Additional Robot Manager pages visible/documented for the C4-class environment
Official v7.5 screenshots/manual sections show a page list including:
- Hands
- Arch
- Locals
- Tools
- Pallets
- ECP
- Boxes
- Planes
- Weight

Older/specific controller/robot configurations also document pages such as:
- Arms
- Inertia
- XYZ Limits
- Range

Page availability is robot/controller/option dependent and must therefore be data-driven rather than hard-coded as universally available.

### Arch
Verified:
- Arch table with seven setting pairs
- Depart Z
- Approach Z
- Apply
- Restore
- Defaults
- Clear
- Used by Jump / Jump3 / Jump3CP motion behavior

### Optional Force integration
When Force Guide is available, official documentation shows a Force page integrated into Robot Manager with panels such as:
- Control
- Trigger
- Coordinate System
- Monitor
- Motion Restriction

This belongs to Full Learning and appears in School Setup only if verified as present/licensed.

## Design consequence

Robot Manager in RC+ Trainer must be implemented as a page registry driven by robot/controller/options/profile capability metadata. The window shell stays the same, while the left-page list and controls reflect the selected robot and installed/learning capabilities.

## Verified RC+ 7.0 v7.5 menu inventory

The official v7.5 documentation confirms this baseline menu structure. Section numbering varies across manual revisions, so commands are tracked by menu/name rather than chapter number.

### File

- Step Into: F11
- Step Over: F10
- Walk: F12
- Resume: F7
- Toggle Breakpoint: F9
- Clear All Breakpoints: Ctrl+Shift+F9
- Display Variables: F4

### Tools
Core documented entries:
- Robot Manager
- Command Window
- I/O Monitor
- Task Manager
- Macros
- I/O Label Editor
- User Error Editor
- Controller

Option/profile-dependent Tools entries documented in v7.5 materials can include capabilities such as:
- Vision / Vision Guide
- Force-related tools such as Force Monitor
- Simulator-related tools and optional modules

The Tools menu must therefore be capability/profile driven.

### Setup
- PC to Controller Communications
- System Configuration
- Preferences
- Options

### Window
- Cascade
- Tile Vertical
- Tile Horizontal
- Arrange Icons
- Close All
- numbered/currently-open-window list
- Windows

The Windows dialog supports operations such as Activate, Save and Close for selected windows.

### Help
- How Do I
- Contents
- Index
- Search
- Manuals
- About EPSON RC+ 7.0

## Verified Build / Run / Status behavior

### Build
- Project > Build performs the minimum compile/link/update work needed to bring the project/controller up to date.
- Build progress is shown in the Status pane.
- Build errors are shown in the Status pane.
- Rebuild recompiles/relinks the entire project and sends project point files as documented.
- Build uses Ctrl+B; Rebuild uses Ctrl+Shift+B.

### Run Window / Operator Window
- Opening Run Window saves changed files as needed, builds the project, and only opens the Run Window when the build succeeds.
- When Auto File Save is disabled, RC+ prompts to save changed files before build/run.
- Run Window is primarily for testing/debugging.
- Operator Window is intended as a simpler operator interface.
- Run Window shortcut is F5; Operator Window is Shift+F5.

### Debugging
- Breakpoints can be toggled from the Run menu, F9, or editor margin where supported.
- When a breakpoint is reached, RC+ opens the source window and highlights the execution line.
- Step Into, Step Over and Walk preserve their documented debugging semantics.
- Resume is available for halted tasks.
- Stop stops running tasks.

### Status pane / status bar
- Status pane is bottom-docked and vertically resizable.
- If closed, it automatically reopens when an important build/error message needs to be shown.
- Build error entries include source context and can be double-clicked to navigate to the relevant source line.
- Status bar includes message/status areas including operation-mode and emergency-stop state in documented configurations.

### RC+ Trainer consequence
RC+ Trainer should preserve these workflows and state transitions, not merely display matching menu names. Commands should enable/disable based on the same conceptual state (active document, dirty files, build state, running/halted tasks, controller/profile capability), with simulation-safe equivalents in Local Simulation mode.

Official baseline:
- EPSON RC+ 7.0 User's Guide v7.5 (official Epson support/download).

## Verified core tool windows: Command, I/O Monitor, Task Manager, Controller / Setup

### Command Window
Official RC+ 7.0 v7.5 behavior:
- Opens from Tools > Command Window, toolbar, or Ctrl+M.
- Presents a prompt using ">".
- Executes SPEL+ commands directly and shows returned results.
- Commands may be entered in upper or lower case.
- Enter executes the command even when the cursor is elsewhere on that prompt line.
- The user waits for the prompt to return before entering the next command.
- Errors display an error number and message.
- A previous prompt line can be revisited with keyboard/mouse and re-executed.
- Official documentation also defines command-window-specific keyboard behavior such as command recall and navigation; these should be inventoried into the shortcut map rather than replaced with generic mobile history UI.

Trainer consequence:
- Local Simulation mode needs a simulated SPEL+ command console over the same runtime/state model as Program/Robot Manager.
- RC+ Digital Twin mode can later route supported commands through the Windows bridge.
- Unsupported/direct commands must never be silently treated as if executed successfully.

### I/O Monitor
Official RC+ 7.0 v7.5 behavior:
- Opens from Tools > I/O Monitor, toolbar, or Ctrl+I.
- Monitors controller hardware inputs/outputs and memory I/O.
- Provides one Standard View plus up to three Custom Views.
- Standard View contains two configurable grids.
- Each grid can monitor configurable I/O type/size such as bit, byte, or word.
- Custom Views can combine input, output, and memory items.
- I/O labels from I/O Label Editor are shown.
- Status is continuously refreshed while the window is open.
- The I/O Monitor remains on top of ordinary child windows in the documented desktop environment.
- Outputs can be toggled by double-clicking the output status LED.
- In Virtual I/O mode, input bits can also be toggled by double-clicking their status LED.
- Hexadecimal display is available for bytes/words.
- The grids support split scroll regions.

Trainer consequence:
- Preserve Standard/Custom View semantics and live status updates.
- Mouse double-click preserves RC+ behavior; touch should use a deliberate equivalent that does not cause accidental I/O changes.
- Local Simulation maps I/O to workcell sensors/actuators and virtual signals.
- School Setup / Full Learning determine which I/O hardware/options appear.

### Task Manager
Official RC+ 7.0 v7.5 behavior:
- Opens from Tools > Task Manager, toolbar, or Ctrl+T.
- Used to halt/suspend, resume/continue, step, and stop/quit tasks.
- Shows a task grid including standard tasks, trap tasks, and background tasks when enabled.
- Documented task information includes:
  - Task number
  - Name
  - Status
  - Type
  - Line
  - Function
  - Program
  - Start time
  - CPU load
- Documented task statuses include Run, Wait, Halt, Pause, Aborted, and Finished.
- Documented task types include Normal, NoPause, and NoEmgAbort.
- CPU-load display is intended to help detect tasks that monopolize controller processing.

Trainer consequence:
- The SPEL+ simulation runtime must expose a real task model rather than faking a static Task Manager UI.
- Program execution/debugging, Run Window, Task Manager, Command Window, and status/debug information should share the same runtime/task state.

### Tools > Controller
Verified controller-maintenance dialog behavior includes:
- Backup Controller...
- Restore Controller...
- View Controller Status...
- Maintenance...
- Reset Controller

Controller manuals describe Tools > Controller as the entry point for backup/restore/maintenance operations.

Trainer consequence:
- Local Simulation should teach the same dialog/workflow using simulated controller state and clearly labeled training backup packages.
- Operations that affect a real connected controller must remain separated from Local Simulation and later require explicit bridge/safety permissions.

### Setup > PC to Controller Communications
Official v7.5 behavior:
- Shows configured connections and current connection/status.
- Connection types can include USB and Virtual in documented examples.
- Supports actions such as Connect, Disconnect, Add, Delete, authentication/password where applicable, Apply, Restore, Work Offline, Auto Connect, Close.
- Work Offline allows project building without a controller but disables some controller-dependent functions such as Robot Manager.

Trainer consequence:
- RC+ Trainer should preserve the same conceptual connection states while adding an unmistakable product-level mode indicator:
  - Local Simulation
  - RC+ Digital Twin
  - future Real Hardware (separately gated)
- The RC+ shell should still teach the native Work Offline/connection workflow rather than replacing it with Visual Lab controls.

### Setup > System Configuration
Official documentation shows System Configuration as a tree-driven dialog for system/controller configuration.
Verified examples include:
- Controller preferences
- Robots / Robot-specific pages
- Robot amplifiers
- Inputs / Outputs
- Fieldbus Master / Slave when installed
- other hardware/controller dependent pages

The Inputs / Outputs page reflects installed hardware and I/O ranges rather than pretending all option boards are present.

Trainer consequence:
- System Configuration must be capability/profile-driven from controller, robot, option, and School Setup / Full Learning metadata.

### Setup > Preferences
Official documentation shows a tree-driven Preferences dialog.
Verified preference groups include:
- Workspace
- Editor
- Robot Manager
  - General
  - Jogging
- Run Window
- Command Window
- GUI Builder
- Simulator
- Language

Robot Manager > General includes the MDI Window vs Dialog display preference.

Trainer consequence:
- Preserve the documented preference organization when it affects the learned RC+ workflow.
- Android-only accessibility/touch preferences should live in a clearly separate application section so they are not confused with official RC+ preferences.

## Architecture implication from these tools

These windows cannot be independent mock screens. They require shared runtime services:
- Project / source model
- SPEL+ parser and execution/runtime model
- task scheduler/state
- virtual/physical I/O abstraction
- controller/profile capability model
- robot state / motion state
- status/error event stream
- connection-mode abstraction

RC+ Trainer windows are therefore views/controllers over shared simulator state. Visual Lab consumes the same state through its own UI.

Official sources used for this inventory:
- EPSON RC+ 7.0 User's Guide v7.5 official Epson manuals.
- Epson RC700/RC90 controller manuals for Tools > Controller maintenance workflows.

## Verified main toolbar baseline (RC+ 7.0 v7.5)

Official RC+ 7.0 v7.5 documentation confirms:
- The main toolbar sits directly below the menu bar.
- Toolbar buttons map to menu commands rather than creating a separate command model.
- Hovering with a pointer shows a tooltip for the command.
- The toolbar is customizable through **Add or Remove Buttons > Main Toolbar**.
- Toolbar command positions are fixed; customization shows/hides commands rather than freely rearranging them.
- A visible connection-status area is part of the toolbar area (for example, Connection: Offline).
- Because RC+ supports optional modules, the available toolbar command set is capability/license dependent.

Verified toolbar command families/buttons include:
- Project Wizard / Wizard
- New
- Open
- Save / Save All (version/context dependent)
- Print
- Cut
- Copy
- Paste
- Find / Find Next / Find Previous / Replace (as supported by the revision)
- Select All
- Indent
- Outdent
- Comment Block
- Uncomment Block
- Build
- Run Window
- Toggle Breakpoint
- Robot Manager
- Command Window
- I/O Monitor
- Task Manager
- Macros
- I/O Label Editor
- User Error Editor
- Simulator
- GUI Builder
- Conveyor Tracking
- Part Feeding
- Vision
- Force Guide
- Force Monitor
- PC-to-Controller / connection control
- Help

Verified RC+ 7 shortcuts for tool/option commands include:
- Robot Manager — F6
- Command Window — Ctrl+M
- I/O Monitor — Ctrl+I
- Task Manager — Ctrl+T
- I/O Label Editor — Ctrl+L
- User Error Editor — Ctrl+U
- Simulator — Ctrl+F5
- GUI Builder — Ctrl+F7
- Conveyor Tracking — Ctrl+F8
- Vision — Ctrl+F9
- Force Monitor — Ctrl+F10
- Force Guide — Ctrl+F11
- Part Feeding — Ctrl+F12

Trainer consequence:
- Preserve toolbar-to-menu command equivalence.
- Preserve the fixed-order/show-hide customization behavior.
- Preserve official shortcut labels where verified.
- Use our own original icons and styling.
- Touch tooltips/help can be exposed through long-press or contextual help without removing pointer hover behavior.

## Robot Manager capability/page matrix baseline

For the confirmed C4-A601S / RC+ 7.0 v7.5 School Setup baseline, the official Robot Manager screenshots/documentation show the left-side page family:
- Control Panel
- Jog & Teach
- Points
- Hands
- Arch
- Locals
- Tools
- Pallets
- ECP
- Boxes
- Planes
- Weight

Other documented robot/controller combinations may additionally or alternatively expose pages such as:
- Arms
- Inertia
- XYZ Limits
- Range
- Force (when Force Guide/force-sensor integration is available)

Capability rules:
- Page availability is driven by robot type, controller model, installed options, and feature support.
- Full Learning may expose documented pages for study even when not present on School Setup, but must label the required capability.
- School Setup should match the verified C4-A601S/controller configuration instead of showing every page indiscriminately.
- Robot Manager is therefore implemented through a page registry + capability predicates, not a hard-coded universal page list.

Current C4-specific verified examples:
- Tools: 15 tool-coordinate definitions with X/Y/Z/U/V/W and Apply/Restore/Defaults/Clear behavior.
- Pallets: pallet definitions, wizard/manual definition, point geometry and row/column structure.
- Jog & Teach: World/Tool/Local/Joint/ECP modes and C4 six-axis XYZUVW/joint controls.
- Points: C4 point spreadsheet including X/Y/Z/U/V/W and point-file operations.
- Arch: Jump/Jump3-related arch parameters.
- Force: optional integration, not assumed to be present in School Setup.

The detailed field/control matrix for every page remains implementation research work, but the window/page architecture is sufficiently established for the formal design spec.

## Full Learning optional-module inventory baseline

Official RC+ 7.0 documentation and Epson option manuals establish these learning domains/options:

### Vision Guide 7.0
- Integrated vision guidance/image-processing environment.
- Has its own vision sequences/objects, properties/results and hardware/setup concepts.
- RC+ contextual help and SPEL+ integration are part of the documented workflow.
- Full Learning should support an educational/simulated vision path independent of actual camera hardware.

### Force Guide 7.0 / Force Control / Force Monitor
- Force-sensor setup and correction.
- Force Guide sequences/objects and SPEL+ commands.
- Force Monitor for current/historical force values.
- Robot Manager Force integration where supported.
- Full Learning can simulate force signals and contact; School Setup only shows the module as installed if verified.

### GUI Builder 7.0
- Optional integrated GUI-development environment within RC+.
- Full Learning target should teach the RC+ GUI Builder workflow using original visual assets/components rather than copying proprietary artwork.

### Conveyor Tracking
- Vision- or sensor-based tracking of moving conveyor workpieces.
- Requires calibration and coordinated robot/conveyor motion.
- This maps naturally to the future Workcell runtime (moving conveyor, encoder/sensor state, tracked parts).

### Part Feeding 7.0 / IntelliFlex feeding integration
- Dedicated Part Feeding window.
- Part definition/configuration and calibration workflow.
- Adds project resources such as PartFeeding.prg, PartFeeding.inc and project configuration data in documented versions.
- Full Learning should preserve the workflow and project relationships while using simulated feeders/parts.

### RC+ API 7.0
- Optional .NET integration for external applications.
- Primarily a learning/documentation/integration target for the Windows bridge; Android does not need to emulate .NET itself.

### Security
- RC+ user/security administration and auditing capability documented as part of the RC+ 7 feature set.
- Full Learning should teach concepts and screens without treating simulated accounts as real controller security.

### PG Motion System / auxiliary axes
- Supports third-party motors/drives for auxiliary equipment such as XY tables/slides.
- Workcell architecture must therefore support auxiliary axes beyond J1-J6.

### ECP
- External Control Point support for CP motion relative to a fixed point.
- Already reflected in Robot Manager coordinate/jog concepts.

### Fieldbus I/O and expansion I/O
- Hardware/controller-dependent I/O expansion and fieldbus configurations.
- Full Learning should expose configuration concepts through the virtual controller capability model.

### Teach pendants / external operator devices
- Hardware-dependent learning domain; not an RC+ MDI window replacement.
- May be represented later as separate simulated devices/workflows.

### Additional communications/integration
Official RC+ 7 materials also document controller communications such as:
- Ethernet / TCP-IP
- serial/RS-232 (controller dependent)
- databases/networking capabilities

These belong to the virtual-controller/runtime capability model, not merely the visual shell.

## Inventory completion status

At architecture level, the remaining fidelity inventory is now sufficient to proceed to design:
- Core menus: inventoried
- Main toolbar behavior/command families: inventoried
- Core Robot Manager page architecture for C4 and capability-driven variants: inventoried
- Build/Run/Status: inventoried
- Command Window / I/O Monitor / Task Manager: inventoried
- Controller / Setup / Preferences: inventoried
- Optional Full Learning domains: inventoried

Future implementation work still requires per-screen field-level verification before each screen/module is marked High-fidelity.
