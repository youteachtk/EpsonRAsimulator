# Architecture

## Layering

### UI
Jetpack Compose screens and controls. Contains no robot mathematics.

### 3D Presentation
Scene graph, camera, visual robot links, tool assets, coordinate frames, ghost pose, paths and workcell visuals.

### Simulation Domain
Pure Kotlin concepts:
- joint state;
- pose;
- robot definition;
- tool definition;
- teach points;
- program actions;
- simulator state.

### Kinematics
Forward kinematics, IK, limit checking, singularity diagnostics and trajectory generation.

### Interaction
Converts touch gestures into target poses and determines whether the gesture manipulates camera, TCP, orientation handle, robot joint or workcell object.

### Persistence
Stores user projects, selected robot/tool, points, lessons and programs.

### External Integration
Reserved for future bridge protocols. It must not be imported by the core simulation module.

## Proposed modules

- app
- core-model
- kinematics
- simulation
- renderer
- tools
- programming
- learning
- persistence
- epson-bridge-protocol (future)

The first commit keeps one Android app module for speed, but domain APIs are placed so they can later be extracted cleanly.

## State flow

Touch input
-> Interaction controller
-> Desired TCP pose
-> IK solver
-> Validation
-> Simulator state
-> 3D renderer + numeric UI

Program execution
-> Program engine
-> Desired action
-> Trajectory planner / tool command
-> Simulator state
-> 3D renderer

## Robot definition strategy

Robot-specific values must not be hard-coded into UI code. A RobotDefinition owns:
- joint types and axes;
- min/max;
- link transforms;
- home position;
- model-node mapping;
- flange frame.

This lets later Epson models reuse the same UI and solvers.

## Tool strategy

Tools implement a capability contract instead of being special-cased in screens. Example capabilities:
- OPEN_CLOSE
- VACUUM
- GRASP
- WELD
- CUSTOM_IO_SIM

A change of tool changes the active TCP and collision model.

## Testing strategy

- pure unit tests for transforms and FK;
- known-pose tests per robot;
- IK round-trip tests;
- joint-limit tests;
- gesture-to-target tests;
- program-engine tests;
- accessory-state tests;
- screenshot/UI tests later;
- physical robot behavior is never assumed from simulator tests.
